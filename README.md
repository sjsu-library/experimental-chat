# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š LlamaIndex Chatbot with Google Gemini

Build a chatbot powered by LlamaIndex that augments Google Gemini with local documents. Based on the chatbot described in <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/build-a-chatbot-with-custom-data-sources-powered-by-llamaindex/">this blog post.</a>

## Overview of the App

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a chat engine that will retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query
