## Simple chat application for experimentation with parameters and prompts
This is a very simple chat application with one twist: for every request, the application returns 10 responses. This repetition can be helpful for exploring parameters that control randomness in the responses of a large language model LLMs. This approach can also be useful in testing prompts that may lead to biased results from specific LLMs - seeing multiple responses to the same prompt can be helpful in understanding the extent and nature of the bias that can be present in LLM results.

This application is configured to use Google Gemini as the LLM.
